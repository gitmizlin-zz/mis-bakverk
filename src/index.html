            <h2 id="history">History</h2>
            <p>The earliest known reference to crème brûlée as it is known today appears in François
                Massialot's 1691 cookbook, and the French name was used in the English translation
                of this book, but the 1731 edition called the same recipe crème anglaise 'English cream'.
                In the early eighteenth century, the dessert was called "burnt cream" in English.
                In Britain, a version of crème brûlée (known locally as "Trinity Cream" or "Cambridge
                burnt cream") was introduced at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1879 with the college
                arms "impressed on top of the cream with a branding iron", though crème brûlée itself
                was not invented at Cambridge. The story goes that the recipe was from an Aberdeenshire
                country house and was offered by an undergraduate, to the college cook, who turned it
                down. However, when the student became a Fellow, he managed to convince the cook to serve
                it.</p>

            <h2 id="crema_catalana">Crema catalana</h2>
            <p>In Catalan cuisine, crema catalana ("Catalan cream") or crema cremada ("Burnt cream"),
                is a dish similar to crème brûlée. It is traditionally served on Saint Joseph's Day
                (March the 19th) although nowadays it is consumed at all times of year. The custard is
                flavored with lemon or orange zest, and cinnamon. The sugar in crema catalana is
                traditionally caramelized under an iron broiler or with a specially made iron, not with
                a flame..</p>

            <h2 id="leite_creme">Leite creme</h2>
            <p>"Leite Creme" is a similar Portuguese dessert; the name is also used for crème caramel.</p>

            <h2 id="technique">Technique</h2>
            <p>Crème brûlée is usually served in individual ramekins. Discs of caramel may be prepared
                separately and put on top just before serving, or the caramel may be formed directly
                on top of the custard, immediately before serving. To do this, sugar is sprinkled onto
                the custard, then caramelized under a salamander broiler or with a butane torch.</p>
